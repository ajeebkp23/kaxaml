  <h1>Welcome to Kaxaml!</h1>
</div>

`Kaxaml` is a lightweight XAML editor that gives you a "split view" so you can see both your XAML and your rendered content (kind of like XamlPad but without the gigabyte of SDK). `Kaxaml` is a hobby and was created to be shared, so it's free!

`Kaxaml` is designed to be "notepad for XAML." It's supposed to be simple and lightweight and make it easy to just try something out. It also has some basic support for intellisense and some fun plugins (including one for snippets, one for cleaning up your XAML and for rendering your XAML to an image).
